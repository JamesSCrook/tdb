# tdb was (and is) an academic exercise.
# It's not even close to being "production quality" code.
# tdb is in dire need of seatbelts and airbags.
# If you feed it valid input, AFAIK, tdb will generate correct output.
# If you feed it bad input, you will very likely get core dumps. You have been warned.
# If it's useful to you, great. If it's not, please don't complain to me about it.
