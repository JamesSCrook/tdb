This illustrates two different approaches to solving the same problem.

First, a single tdb program that uses "brute force" to calculate the totals
and subtotals.
This is scr1 and bothpasses.r

scr1 data			# to see the output
scr1 data | diff OUT.REF -	# no differences means tdb is working

Second, a two-pass approach is used to simplify the report writing process.
This is scr2, pass1.r and pass2.r.
scr2 data			# to see the output
scr2 data | diff OUT.REF -	# no differences means tdb is working
