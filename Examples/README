The following example directories contain tdb files that are to be executed as
follows:

groceries:
quotes:
tdbquick:
timesheets:
university:
    scr data | diff OUT.REF -		This should produce no output.


budget:
    scr1 data | diff OUT.REF -		This should produce no output.
    scr2 data | diff OUT.REF -		This should produce no output.


bulk:
    scr		This takes a while to create some unsorted data, which is then
		sorted in both ascending and descending order.  tdb is then
		called six times, as follows:)

		    input file     data file
		    ----------     ---------
		    val1val2.r     data.unsorted
		    val1val2.r     data.ascending
		    val1val2.r     data.descending

		    val2val1.r     data.unsorted
		    val2val1.r     data.ascending
		    val2val1.r     data.descending

		The output produced is a bunch of status message, plus any
		output statistics produced by the 'time' command.  At the end
		of the each triple, the following lines should appear:

		    checking output differences:
		    (There should be nothing between the lines)
		    ----------------- Ascending differences -------------------
		    ----------------- Descending differences ------------------
		    ----------------- End of difference checking --------------

		Note: the file OUT.REF contains stdout _only_!
